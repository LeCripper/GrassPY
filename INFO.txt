Hi, here's some info about GrassPY.

Before you can code;
you have to go to:
File Manager --> Plugins --> create new file --> call it whatever you'd like, and add ".gp" in the end.
to reload the file write: "/grasspy reload <filename>.gp"

What it can do:
  print("print text")
  print(f"print {variables}")
  print(1 + 1 <-- do math)
  sleep(<seconds>)
  valueof var = "value" print("check if variables are equal to X")
  from "block.note_block" { // create & use minecraft's sound system faster & easier
    play "guitar"
    time.sleep(0.1)
    play "guitar"
  }
  give(<ITEM>) // gives an item
  openGui("<name>", <rows>, <slot>) // create a gui, name does support color-codes and you can have up to 70 slots depending on the GUI size
  var = "value" // declare a variable, name must be 3 letters long.
  // comment
